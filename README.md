# Data Analysis of Hall A Using ROOT Applications in Jupyter

## Detectors

In Hall A of Jefferson Labs, the exploration of deep-inelastic electron scattering is facilitated by two matching high-resolution spectrometers: BigBite and SuperBigBite. This repository contains Jupyter Notebook tutorials detailing data acquisition with the two spectrometers and data analysis using ROOT, PyROOT, and Uproot.

For an overview of the detectors, visit the <a href="main.ipynb">main.ipynb</a> notebook.

## Jupyter

Jefferson Lab employees and users often utilize Jupyter environments to analyze data with ROOT, facilitated by JLab's JupyterHub.

An introduction to some of the features of Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the <a href="markdown.ipynb">markdown.ipynb</a> notebook.

## ROOT

ROOT is a C++ data analysis framework created by CERN and commonly used by high energy physicists.

Our ROOT tutorial:  <a href="root.ipynb">root.ipynb</a>

Official ROOT documentation:  <a href="https://root.cern/">https://root.cern/</a>

## PyROOT

PyROOT creates bindings between Python and C++, allowing for the full funcionality of ROOT while in Python.

Our PyROOT tutorial:  <a href="pyroot.ipynb">pyroot.ipynb</a>

Official PyROOT documentation:  <a href="https://root.cern/manual/python/">https://root.cern/manual/python/</a>

## Uproot

Uproot is a Python library which enables the input and output of ROOT files directly in Python, removing the need for the ROOT framework.
