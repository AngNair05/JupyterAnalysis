# JupyterAnalysis

In Hall A of Jefferson Labs, the exploration of deep-inelastic electron scattering is facilitated by two matching high-resolution spectrometers: BigBite and SuperBigBite. This repository contains tutorials for data analysis in Root, PyRoot, UpRoot, and Markdown. We also have an overview of the BigBite and SuperBigBite Spectrometers.
